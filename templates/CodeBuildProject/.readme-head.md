Creates a CodeBuild project, an optional ECR repository, and associated
resources and permissions.

Within the build run, the following environment variables are defined:

- `REVISION` - The value of the `DefaultRevision` parameter unless overridden at
  launch time.
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` - The ID CodeBuild project's account.
- `IMAGE_REPO_NAME` - The name of the optional ECS repository.

You can also specify up to six additional environment variables by specifying
the `ExtraEnv*` parameters. These can be used either to provide fixed values or
as prompts to be defined at launch time.
