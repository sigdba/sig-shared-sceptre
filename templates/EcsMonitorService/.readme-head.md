# EcsMonitorService

Provides a metric for memory utilization of EC2-backed ECS containers. This
provides a significantly less expensive alternative to AWS' Container Insights
as it only gathers one metric per container.

The service operates as a small Docker image which runs on each node in the ECS
cluster.
