# GlobalLogRetentionRules

Creates an AWS Lambda function which runs on a schedule to set the retention of
CloudWatch log groups.

CloudWatch log groups are often created automatically and without a retention
period set. This leads to unwanted data being retained long past its usefulness
while increasing AWS costs. Use this stack in each active region to ensure
you're not paying for logs you don't want.
